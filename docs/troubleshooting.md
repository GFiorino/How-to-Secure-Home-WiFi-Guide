# Troubleshooting Common Wi-Fi Issues

This section provides solutions to common Wi-Fi issues that users may encounter while securing their network.

## 1. Cannot Log into the Router
### Possible Causes:
- Incorrect router IP address.
- Wrong username or password.

### Solution:
1. Try accessing the router using `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`.
2. If the login credentials are incorrect, check the router’s label for default details.
3. If still unable to log in, reset the router by holding the reset button for **10–15 seconds**.

## 2. Wi-Fi is Slow or Keeps Disconnecting
### Possible Causes:
- Too many devices connected.
- Signal interference from walls or other electronic devices.
- Outdated firmware.

### Solution:
1. Reduce the number of connected devices to optimize bandwidth.
2. Move the router to a **central location** with minimal obstructions.
3. Update the router firmware through the **admin settings panel**.
4. Switch to **5 GHz Wi-Fi** if supported, as it offers faster speeds with less interference.

## 3. Unknown Device Appears on the Network
### Possible Causes:
- Unauthorized access due to a weak Wi-Fi password.
- Guest network is open or not secured properly.

### Solution:
1. Immediately **change the Wi-Fi password** and ensure encryption is set to **WPA3 or WPA2**.
2. Check the **Guest Network settings** and ensure it has a **strong password**.
3. Enable **MAC address filtering** to allow only trusted devices to connect.

## 4. Router Keeps Restarting or Crashing
### Possible Causes:
- Overheating due to poor ventilation.
- Outdated firmware or hardware failure.

### Solution:
1. Place the router in a **well-ventilated area** away from heat sources.
2. Check for and install **firmware updates**.
3. If the issue persists, consider **resetting to factory settings** or replacing the router.

## 5. Wi-Fi Signal Does Not Reach Certain Areas
### Possible Causes:
- Router location is not optimal.
- Signal interference from walls, appliances, or other networks.

### Solution:
1. Relocate the router to a **higher and more central position**.
2. Use a **Wi-Fi extender or mesh network** to boost coverage.
3. Reduce interference by switching to **5 GHz Wi-Fi** or changing the Wi-Fi channel in router settings.
