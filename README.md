## Introduction

Cybercrimes are on the rise worldwide. This guide will help you secure your home Wi-Fi in 8 simple steps, improving your network's security by up to 80%. This way, you and your family can navigate the internet more safely while connected to your home Wi-Fi.

---

## Requirements

To follow this guide and secure your home Wi-Fi, you will need the following:

1. **Access to Router Configuration Panel**: Typically accessible via an IP address like `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`.
2. **Router Login Credentials**: Default credentials can often be found on the router's label.
3. **Internet Browser**: Any modern browser like **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Safari**, or **Edge** to access the router's settings.
4. **Device Connected to the Router**: A **PC, laptop, or smartphone** connected to your Wi-Fi or through an Ethernet cable to make changes to the settings.
5. **Knowledge of Your Wi-Fi Network Name (SSID)**: Helpful for identifying your network during configuration.

These requirements will ensure you have everything needed to successfully follow each of the steps outlined in the guide.

## Step 1: Changing Default Router Credentials

### What it means:
Home routers come with default factory setups. Hackers can easily find this information. Changing the default username and password to something only you know adds an extra layer of security to your home Wi-Fi.

### How you do it:
1. Check the label on your router for the default username and password.
2. Log into the router’s admin interface by typing your router's IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.1) into your browser or using the app provided by your internet provider.
3. Go to **Settings** (or **Admin**).
4. Change the default username and password with new ones that are at least 7 characters long, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols (e.g., &, %, $).
5. Save the changes and log out.

## Step 2: Enabling Network Encryption (WPA3)

### What it means:
Encryption scrambles your internet data to prevent unauthorized access. Enabling WPA3 encryption (or WPA2 if WPA3 isn’t available) will make it harder for anyone to spy on your online activities.

### How you do it:
1. Log into your router's admin interface.
2. Go to **Wi-Fi Settings** (or **Wireless**).
3. Select **Security Mode** (or **Encryption Type**) and choose WPA3 (or WPA2 if WPA3 isn’t available).
4. Save the changes.

---

## Step 3: Updating Router Firmware

### What it means:
Firmware updates fix vulnerabilities in your router, similar to how a plumber fixes problems in an old house. Without updates, your router may be vulnerable to hackers.

### How you do it:
1. Log into your router’s admin interface and go to the **Firmware Update** section.
2. Look for update notifications.
3. Download and install available updates.

---

## Step 4: Disable Remote Management

### What it means:
Remote Management allows external devices to access your router, similar to leaving a spare key outside your house. It's convenient but poses security risks. If you don’t use this feature, it’s safer to disable it.

### How you do it:
1. Log into your router’s admin interface and find **Remote Management** settings.
2. Click **Disable** (or **Off**).
3. Save the changes.

---

## Step 5: Strong Wi-Fi Password

### What it means:
A password acts like a lock for your network. A strong password makes it harder for hackers to access your Wi-Fi.

### How you do it:
1. Log into your router’s admin interface and go to **Wi-Fi Settings** (or **Wireless Security**).
2. Click on **Change Password** and enter a new password that’s at least 7 characters long, containing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
3. Save the changes.

---

## Step 6: Set Up a Guest Network

### What it means:
A guest network provides internet access to your visitors while keeping them separate from your main home network.

### How you do it:
1. Log into your router’s admin interface and go to **Guest Network** settings.
2. Enable the **Guest Network** and set a separate password for visitors.
3. Save the changes.

---

## Step 7: Disable WPS

### What it means:
WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) is an older, less secure method for connecting devices to a router. Since you already enabled WPA3 (or WPA2), it's safer to disable WPS to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

### How you do it:
1. Log into your router’s admin interface and go to **WPS** settings.
2. Ensure WPS is disabled.
3. Save the changes.

---

## Step 8: Enable Firewall & Monitor Network

### What it means:
A firewall is a basic security system that helps block malicious traffic. It’s also wise to regularly check what devices are connected to your network and remove any unknown or suspicious ones.

### How you do it:
1. Log into your router’s admin interface and go to **Firewall Settings**.
2. Ensure the firewall is enabled.
3. Regularly check the **Network Logs** for unknown devices and disconnect any suspicious ones.
4. Save the changes and log out.

## Common Troubleshooting

- **Wi-Fi Network Not Visible**: Ensure that the router’s SSID (network name) is set to broadcast in the router's settings under "Wireless" or "Wi-Fi". If it's hidden, manually enter the SSID on your device.
- **Unable to Connect After Changing Wi-Fi Password**: Ensure the correct password is entered, and try forgetting and reconnecting to the network if necessary.
- **Slow Internet Speed**: Restart the router and modem. Place the router centrally in your home, away from obstacles. Also, check if too many devices are connected.
- **Unable to Login to the Router**: Use the default username and password on the router label. If these don’t work, reset the router by pressing the reset button (usually a small hole at the back) for 10-15 seconds with a paperclip.

## Glossary

- **Internet Browser**: An application to access the internet (e.g., Safari, Chrome).
- **WPA2/WPA3 Encryption**: Standards used to protect data on Wi-Fi networks. WPA3 is more secure than WPA2.
- **SSID (Service Set Identifier)**: The name of your Wi-Fi network.
- **WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)**: A method to connect devices to a router by pressing a button, considered less secure than WPA.
- **Router Firmware**: Software that controls the router’s functionality, which should be kept up to date.
- **Firewall**: A system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic to prevent malicious activity.
