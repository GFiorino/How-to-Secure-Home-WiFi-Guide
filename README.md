## **📌 Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1️⃣ Change Default Router Credentials**
🔹 **Why?** Default passwords are widely known and easily exploited.

**How to change it:**
1. Open a web browser and enter your router’s IP address (**192.168.1.1** or **192.168.0.1**).
2. Log in using the default credentials (usually printed on the router).
3. Find the **Admin Settings** and update:
   - **Username**: Use something unique.
   - **Password**: Use a strong mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.
4. Save changes and **log out**.

### **2️⃣ Enable Strong Encryption (WPA3)**
🔹 **Why?** Encryption scrambles data, making it unreadable to attackers.

**How to enable WPA3:**
1. Access your router’s **Wireless Security Settings**.
2. Select **WPA3** (or WPA2 if WPA3 is unavailable).
3. Save changes and restart the router.

✅ **Tip:** If your router does not support WPA3, consider upgrading for better security.

---

### **3️⃣ Update Your Router Firmware**
🔹 **Why?** Older firmware may contain security vulnerabilities.

**How to update:**
1. Log into your router’s admin panel.
2. Navigate to the **Firmware Update** section.
3. Check for available updates and install them.
4. Restart the router to apply changes.

✅ **Tip:** Set firmware updates to **automatic** if your router allows it.

---

### **4️⃣ Disable Remote Management**
🔹 **Why?** Prevents hackers from accessing your router’s settings remotely.

**How to disable:**
1. Log into your router and go to **Advanced Settings**.
2. Find **Remote Management / Remote Access**.
3. Disable it and save changes.

---

### **5️⃣ Set a Strong Wi-Fi Password**
🔹 **Why?** A weak password allows unauthorized access to your network.

**How to set a strong password:**
1. Log into your router’s **Wi-Fi Settings**.
2. Set a **complex** password (**12+ characters**, mix of **letters, numbers, and symbols**).
3. Save and reconnect your devices.

✅ **Example Password:** `M@sterNet$ecure2025`

---

### **6️⃣ Create a Guest Network**
🔹 **Why?** Keeps visitors from accessing your private devices.

**How to set up:**
1. Log into your router and find **Guest Network Settings**.
2. Enable **Guest Network** and set a different password.
3. Restrict guest access to **internet only** (no device sharing).
4. Save changes.

✅ **Tip:** Give your guest network a fun name!  
Example: **“Café WiFi – Guests Only”**

---

### **7️⃣ Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)**
🔹 **Why?** WPS has security flaws that allow hackers easy access.

**How to disable WPS:**
1. Go to your router’s **Wireless Settings**.
2. Locate **WPS** (Wi-Fi Protected Setup).
3. **Disable it** and save changes.

---

### **8️⃣ Enable Firewall & Monitor Connected Devices**
🔹 **Why?** A firewall blocks suspicious traffic, and monitoring prevents intrusions.

**How to enable:**
1. Go to your router’s **Firewall Settings**.
2. **Turn it ON** and enable intrusion detection if available.
3. Check the **Connected Devices List** to ensure only authorized devices are using your Wi-Fi.
